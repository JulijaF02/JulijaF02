**Software Engineer with a Game Development Background**

I’m a software engineer with professional experience in game development, where I built and shipped performance-sensitive systems and internal tools in production environments. My background in games shaped how I think about system design, iteration speed, and maintainable code.

I’m currently focusing on backend and full-stack development, applying the same systems thinking to APIs, data modeling, and service architecture.
